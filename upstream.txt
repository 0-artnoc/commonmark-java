Fixes:
* out/cr in html.js

Suggestions:
* instead of type being String, make "enum"
* opt: in html renderer, instead of doing out(tag()), and throwing away the tag,
  make tag() write to buffer and return early
* node.info.split(/ +/): only uses first element
* Keep parser state out of node, e.g. strings, string_content
* in parseListMarker, construct object from local variables at the end

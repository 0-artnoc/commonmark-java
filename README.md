commonmark-java
===============

Java implementation of [CommonMark], a specification of the [Markdown] format for turning plain text into formatted text.
Parses input to an AST (tree of nodes) and then renders to HTML.

This started out as a port of [commonmark.js] and has evolved into a full
library with a nice Java API and some optional extensions.

Design goals:

* Small with minimal dependencies
* Extensible (see below)

Requirements:

* Java 7 or above
* The core has no dependencies; for extensions, see below

Coordinates for core library:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.atlassian.commonmark</groupId>
    <artifactId>commonmark</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Note that for 0.x releases of this library, the API is not considered stable
yet and may break between minor releases. After 1.0, [Semantic Versioning] will
be followed.


Usage
-----

Basic example:

```java
import org.commonmark.html.HtmlRenderer;
import org.commonmark.node.Node;
import org.commonmark.parser.Parser;

Parser parser = Parser.builder().build();
Node document = parser.parse("This is *Sparta*");
HtmlRenderer renderer = HtmlRenderer.builder().escapeHtml(true).build();
renderer.render(document);  // "<p>This is <em>Sparta</em></p>\n"
```

This uses the parser and renderer with default options, except for escaping raw
HTML tags and blocks. For all the available options, see other methods on the
builder objects.

Note that this library doesn't try to sanitize HTML; that is the responsibility
of the caller.


Extensions
----------

Extensions need to extend the parser, or the HTML renderer, or both. To
configure an extension, the builder objects have a method for passing a list of
extensions. Let's look at how to enable tables (from GitHub Flavored Markdown):

```java
import org.commonmark.ext.gfm.tables.TablesExtension;

List<Extension> extensions = Arrays.asList(TablesExtension.create());
Parser parser = Parser.builder().extensions(extensions).build();
HtmlRenderer renderer = HtmlRenderer.builder().extensions(extensions).build();
```

To configure another extension in the above example, just add it to the list.

The following extensions are developed with this library. Note that they are not
in the same artifact as the core library, so you will need to add additional
dependencies.

### Autolink

Turns plain links such as URLs and email addresses into links (based on [autolink-java]).

Use class `AutolinkExtension` from artifact `commonmark-ext-autolink`.

### Strikethrough

Enables strikethrough of text by enclosing it in `~~`. For example, in
`hey ~~you~~`, `you` will be rendered as strikethrough text.

Use class `StrikethroughExtension` in artifact `commonmark-ext-gfm-strikethrough`.

### Tables

Enables tables using pipes as in [GitHub Flavored Markdown][gfm-tables].

Use class `TablesExtension` in artifact `commonmark-ext-gfm-tables`.
